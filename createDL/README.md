## Changes:
1. Added "occupancy" and "replacementCost" in exampleBIM.json and made corresponding changes in  Building.cpp
2. In the exampleEDP.json, a new variable should be added to show whether the building is collapsed. Or, set all EDP = -1 if the building is collapsed.


## Todo:
1. Should modify Building::readEDP() method
