# Description: Contains applications neeed for a regional loss estimaion
# due to an earthquake event. Applications in subdirectories:

1. createBIM - given UrbanSim data generate BIM models
2. createEVENT - given BIM model get input motion for building (the EVENT)
3. createSAM - given BIM and EVENT use Hazus data to generate a shear model
4. createEDP - given the inputs so far generate the EDP demands
5. performSIMULATION - given all, fill the EDP with data
6. createDL - given all, determine the DL.

NOTE: the applications require the jansson lib be installed. jansson is 
a free BSD lib recomended online for dealing with reading/writing json files.
It is assumed installed in /usr/local/jansson as seen in Makefiles.

NOTE: each subsirectory included provides an application and include example 
input and output .json (the input coming from previous step, the output 
generated by the application given the inputs)

NOTE: running an application w/o any inputs shows what the command line args
should be.
